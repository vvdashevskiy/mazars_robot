Shah, A. Schönhuth;The recent boom in microfluidics and combinatorial indexing strategies, combined with low sequencing costs, has empowered single-cell sequencing technology. Thousands—or even millions—of cells analyzed in a single experiment amount to a data revolution in single-cell biology and pose unique data science problems. Here, we outline eleven challenges that will be central to bringing this emerging field of single-cell data science forward. For each challenge, we highlight motivating research questions, review prior work, and formulate open problems. This compendium is for established researchers, newcomers, and students alike, highlighting interesting and rewarding problems for the coming years.;265;https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-1926-6;https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13059-020-1926-6.pdf
Leveraging Data Science to Combat COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review;Siddique Latif, Muhammad Usman, Sanaullah Manzoor, Waleed Iqbal, Junaid Qadir, Gareth Tyson, Ignacio Castro, A. Razi, M. Boulos, Adrian Weller, J. Crowcroft;COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020. At the time of writing, more than 1.8 million people have tested positive. Infections have been growing exponentially and tremendous efforts are being made to fight the disease. In this paper, we attempt to systematise ongoing data science activities in the area. As well as reviewing the rapidly growing body of recent research, we survey public datasets and repositories that can be used for further work to track COVID19 spread and mitigation strategies. As part of this, we present a bibliometric analysis of the papers produced in this short span of time. Finally, building on these insights, we highlight common challenges and pitfalls observed across the surveyed works.;80;;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0d20/844da1856482d328fd26ba5309f3e655a6e5.pdf
Human Data Science;Daniel L. Oberski;Most data science is about people, and opinions on the value of human data differ. The author offers a synthesis of overly optimistic and overly pessimistic views of human data science: it should become a science, with errors systematically studied and their effects mitigated—a goal that can only be achieved by bringing together expertise from a range of disciplines.;48;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33205117;https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdf/S2666-3899(20)30089-1.pdf
How do Data Science Workers Collaborate? Roles, Workflows, and Tools;Amy X. Zhang, Michael J. Muller, Dakuo Wang;Today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. However, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. In this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. We focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook). We found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). We also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions.;42;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06684;
Cybersecurity data science: an overview from machine learning perspective;I. H. Sarker, A. Kayes, Shahriar Badsha, Hamed AlQahtani, P. Watters, Alex Ng;In a computing context, cybersecurity is undergoing massive shifts in technology and its operations in recent days, and data science is driving the change. Extracting security incident patterns or insights from cybersecurity data and building corresponding data-driven model , is the key to make a security system automated and intelligent. To understand and analyze the actual phenomena with data, various scientific methods, machine learning techniques, processes, and systems are used, which is commonly known as data science. In this paper, we focus and briefly discuss on cybersecurity data science , where the data is being gathered from relevant cybersecurity sources, and the analytics complement the latest data-driven patterns for providing more effective security solutions. The concept of cybersecurity data science allows making the computing process more actionable and intelligent as compared to traditional ones in the domain of cybersecurity. We then discuss and summarize a number of associated research issues and future directions . Furthermore, we provide a machine learning based multi-layered framework for the purpose of cybersecurity modeling. Overall, our goal is not only to discuss cybersecurity data science and relevant methods but also to focus the applicability towards data-driven intelligent decision making for protecting the systems from cyber-attacks.;41;https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40537-020-00318-5;
Big-Data Science in Porous Materials: Materials Genomics and Machine Learning;K. Jablonka, D. Ongari, S. M. Moosavi, B. Smit;By combining metal nodes with organic linkers we can potentially synthesize millions of possible metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). The fact that we have so many materials opens many exciting avenues but also create new challenges. We simply have too many materials to be processed using conventional, brute force, methods. In this review, we show that having so many materials allows us to use big-data methods as a powerful technique to study these materials and to discover complex correlations. The first part of the review gives an introduction to the principles of big-data science. We show how to select appropriate training sets, survey approaches that are used to represent these materials in feature space, and review different learning architectures, as well as evaluation and interpretation strategies. In the second part, we review how the different approaches of machine learning have been applied to porous materials. In particular, we discuss applications in the field of gas storage and separation, the stability of these materials, their electronic properties, and their synthesis. Given the increasing interest of the scientific community in machine learning, we expect this list to rapidly expand in the coming years.;65;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00004;
